abstract = "We propose and study the use of geographic hints to aid memorability of passphrase-style authentication secrets. Geographic hints are map locations that are selected by the user at the time of passphrase creation, and shown to the user as a hint at the time of passphrase login. We implement the *GeoHints* system and analyze how geographic hints impact the usability and security of passphrase-style secrets in a multi-session user study (n=38). The study involved testing for multiple passphrase interference—each participant was asked to recall 4 distinct passphrases. Our study indicates that while geographic hints showed promise for reducing memory interference, GeoHints (as implemented) does not produce a viable authentication system, as the login success rate was 25%, 7–11 days after passphrase selection. We analyze the root causes of login errors, finding that most were due to inexact recall of free-form text input. This finding points towards opportunities to improve the system design, and we suggest improvements that we believe will lead to viable systems that employ geographic hints."
