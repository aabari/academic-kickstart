# About
I am an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Business and Information Technology at Ontario Tech University, where I co-lead the [SAIN lab](https://sain.ca/). Prior that, I was an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow, with a joint appointment at University of Toronto (UofT) and University of Waterloo (UW). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UofT in 2016. My research is on designing, exploring and extending the capabilities of user-centered intelligent systems, aiming to automate or assist the human decision making. I have contributed in various areas of computer science such as artificial intelligence, computer security and privacy, applied machine learning, recommender systems, algorithms, and human-computer interaction.
